## Features

### Attack Bases Mode

When attacking purple/red "M"s are lit. Each base's shield strength is shown in displays. Reducing a base's shields to zero lights the corresponding "activate warbase" light. Shoot the base to destroy it. A destroyed base will respawn with more shields. Attack damage is based on other modes.

### Attack Bases Multiball

Destroying a level 3 base will lock the ball for Attack Bases Multiball. Locking two balls starts Attack Bases Multiball. During multiball, base hits score a jackpot.

### Build Fleet Mode

Shooting drop targets adds ships to fleet. Levels complete when right extra ball standup is shot before time runs out. If mode time out, only percentage of recruited piolets are successfully retained.
 
* Modes:
 * 60s per mode? On ball start selection is available until first switch hit. During ball,
 * mode selection is done by shooting any hole. When in hole, 5s to choose mode then auto starts.
 * 3. Research Weapons
 *      Weapon development is risky. Weapons are research is increased by shooting lit
 *      pop bumpers and decreased by shooting unlit pop bumpers. Bumpers are lit by shooting
 *      MARS rollovers. Stargate ramp raised to allow MARS shots. Weapon research is put
 *      into production by shooting any hole to complete level. Level difficulty requires
 *      additional shots to each MARS (go from lit, various blink rates, off). If mode times out,
 *      only a percentage of research is retained.
 * -
 * Attack power/bonus blaster/multiplier is based off fleet size & weapon strength.
 * Shown as bonus multiplier.
 * -
 * Unused features:
 *      Multiball, Bonus Value lights, Spinner, Launch, Special, lower left/right extra balls,
 *      lights approaching Stargate. Ramp state.
 * Ideas:
 * - Spinner does something during modes (and requires periodic shots) like
*       "increase moral" when building fleet, improve "health and safety" during research, etc.
        Maybe lights approaching spinner count up/down to indicate urgency of shot.
    - Multiball earned at level X of each mode. Could retain captive ball to increase difficulty
        of completing mode (less captive holes to shoot.) Will affect subsequent players.
    - Higher levels require some sort of defense, or player looses resources. This is a
        counter-attack by Mars. Hurry-up mode? In defend modes, bonus value indicates your health?
        Drop targets damage mars, light targets move, reset freqency can change. Killing Mars
        before health runs out keeps resources, defeat means Mars takes resources. Maybe healt
        Starts at 10, ticks down, but can be increases beyond 10 somehow? Completing modes
        adds health? Non-mission targets add health (at some decreasing rate?)
